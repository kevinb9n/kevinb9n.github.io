/**
 * Monotone cubic spline interpolator. Unlike other Hermite interpolators (such as Catmull-Rom),
 * this interpolator sacrifices continuity of the second derivative for the absence of
 * overshooting (wherein a spline segment overshoots a control point and reverses direction to
 * intersect the point). This implementation is adapted from the JavaScript implementation in
 * Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotone_cubic_interpolation#Example_implementation).
 * The algorithm is due to Fritsch & Carlson, (1980) ("Monotone Piecewise Cubic Interpolation".
 * SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis. SIAM. 17 (2): 238â€“246). It is the algorithm used by
 * MATLAB's PCHIP interpolator.
