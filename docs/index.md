## Work

I graduated in 1997, had about 6 jobs and the joined Google in 2004. In 2007 I founded the Java Core Libraries team, and I'm still there today! (We are now named Java And Kotlin Ecosystems.)

If you're very curious, you could learn a bit about what I do from the [start of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPW2Pz2dI9E) until you get bored.

My mission is basically to do whatever I can make the world's Java/Kotlin code more readable, bug-resistant, adaptable, and reusable. And... I love it!

### Things I did

I've played some important part in creating these things. Clearly I love to collaborate. Often it sounds like I didn't do that much, but listen man.

I'm generally still connected to these projects but (frustratingly to many, I'm sure), not able to pay much active attention to them nowadays.

* I made [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) with much early help from Jared Levy, Mike Bostock, Joshua Bloch, Jesse Wilson, Bob Lee, Chris Povirk, Louis Wasserman, Chris Nokleberg, and others. I spearheaded, but it would be ludicrous to think I could have done it alone.
* I helped Bob Lee (crazybob) create Guice 1.0. A fair amount of the API design is me. The fact that it worked was all Bob. Working with him was a fantastic and formative experience for me, and I mourn his loss tremendously.
* [AutoValue](https://github.com/google/auto/blob/master/value/userguide/index.md) was my idea/design and I sort of product-managed and tech-wrote. Ã‰amonn McManus made it happen and has maintained it well.
* I worked as hard on [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) as it's possible to work on a thing without writing any of the code. It is really the creation of John DeTreville and Liam Miller-Cushon. I had to make the tough decisions though.
* Jesse Wilson, Gregory Kick, and I created [Caliper](https://github.com/google/caliper). It's dying now; [JMH](https://github.com/openjdk/jmh) is just better.
* I've been closely involved in [Error Prone](https://errorprone.info/) (including Refaster) since its early days, helping Alex Eagle, Liam Miller-Cushon, Eddie Aftandillian, and Louis Wasserman (again, like most Google projects, *many* people have contributed).
* Deep API discussions and reviews for [Truth](https://github.com/google/truth) (Christian Gruber, Chris Povirk, Kurt Kluever), David Beaumont's [Flogger](https://github.com/google/flogger), and Colin Decker's [jimfs](https://github.com/google/jimfs). For whatever it matters, I still believe these are all excellent libraries, which might be better known if we had really evangelized them.
* I've been Google's representative to [JSR 330](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=330), [JSR 335](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=335), Project Valhalla, Project Amber, and maybe another I'm forgetting. Particularly with Valhalla I've had a significant influence on the design... so I hope y'all like it when it gets here.

### Things I wrote

* [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), with Erik Hilsdale. This is possibly the most-adopted Java style guide in the world, and several other guides have been derived from it (examples: [Android](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/style-guide), [Javascript](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)).
* [Understanding classes and types in Java](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G5dNQ0kQwA5zefGdP_nvFJByb63QNlz0XiSjltiJM84/preview?resourcekey=0-HXOJZriWDQ_lN0iqZR9nXQ)
* [Data in Java programs: a basic conceptual model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J-a_K87P-R3TscD4uW2Qsbt5BlBR_7uX_BekwJ5BLSE/preview)
* Much more is coming soon in 2023.

### Current projects 

* Head of [JSpecify](http://jspecify.org) working group
* Representative to [Project Amber](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/amber/) working group
* Representative to [Project Valhalla](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/valhalla/) working group
* I work in groups

### Play

I like board games. My favorite game is Terraforming Mars. I have some stuff [here](http://github.com/MartianZoo) fans might be interested in, including a game engine library that's kicking my ass. But I have something like 300 other games too. Board games are neato. Video games not so much, unless it's BioWare.

I like math a lot and used to coach a Math Olympiad team for 10-year-olds before covid. I was really good at it too, aside from the ways in which I was bad at it.

I'm from Ohio and I like going to Cedar Point.

I like road trips. I've been to 43 U.S. states (I think), but have only left the country like three times (Canada does not count).

#### Music

I play guitar decently, sing decently, play drums not that decently, am a bad keyboard player, and like every guitar player I think I can play the bass too but actually can't. I love music. I put some stuff up on YouTube, some I feel good about, some I really don't.

I'm very into The Beatles, Radiohead, Belle & Sebastian, Elliott Smith, Paul Simon, Vampire Weekend, Aimee Mann, The Shins, Neutral Milk Hotel, and stuff like that. Music means everything to me. Oh and musicals. I love musicals, but I'm a poseur who mostly just likes the modern ones: Book of Mormon, Waitress, Hamilton, Something Rotten, Come From Away...

However, an artist who is very very special to me and my family is Melissa Kaplan aka Universal Hall Pass, formerly of Splashdown. Her singing, lyrics, vocal arrangements, and overall sensibilities are jaw-dropping out of this world amazing. And like no one knows about her, which makes me sad. Really, [try out this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGbvfaO4ht4&list=PLLkghk8DC6eb-eMh8syfH1UfGDs55B8Da) and if you don't like one song just try another. I can't imagine someone finding nothing to love in it.
