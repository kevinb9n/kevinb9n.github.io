## Work

After working at six small companies in six years, I joined Google in 2004. In 2007 I founded the Java Core Libraries team, and I'm still there today! (We are now named Java And Kotlin Ecosystems.)

If you're very curious, you could learn a bit about what I do from the [start of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPW2Pz2dI9E) until you get bored.

### Things I've done

I've played some important part in creating these things for the Java community, and am generally still connected to nearly all of these projects, but (frustratingly to many, I know) unable to pay active attention to them lately.

* I drove the creation of [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava), with much early help from Jared Levy, Mike Bostock, Joshua Bloch, Jesse Wilson, Chris Povirk, Louis Wasserman, Chris Nokleberg, and *many* others.
* I helped crazybob create Guice 1.0. A fair amount of the API design is me. The fact that it worked was all Bob.
* [AutoValue](https://github.com/google/auto/blob/master/value/userguide/index.md) was my original idea and design, and would 100% have gone nowhere if Ã‰amonn McManus hadn't coded the entire thing up and maintained it so well. In essence I product-managed and tech-wrote.
* I worked as hard on [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) as it's possible to work on a thing without writing any of the code. It is really the creation of John DeTreville and Liam Miller-Cushon. 
* Jesse Wilson, Gregory Kick, and I created [Caliper](https://github.com/google/caliper). It's dying now; [JMH](https://github.com/openjdk/jmh) is basically just better.
* I've been closely involved in [Error Prone](https://errorprone.info/) (including Refaster) since its early days, helping Alex Eagle, Liam Miller-Cushon, Eddie Aftandillian, and Louis Wasserman (again, like most Google projects, *many* people have contributed).
* I went through many (many) discussions and deep design reviews for [Truth](https://github.com/google/truth) (Christian Gruber, Chris Povirk, Kurt Kluever), David Beaumont's [Flogger](https://github.com/google/flogger), and Colin Decker's [jimfs](). For whatever it matters, I still believe these are all excellent libraries, which we failed to evangelize.
* I've been Google's representative to [JSR 330](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=330), [JSR 335](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=335), Project Valhalla, Project Amber, and maybe another I'm forgetting. Particularly with Valhalla I've had a strong influence on the design... so I hope y'all like it when it gets here.

### Things I wrote

* [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), with Erik Hilsdale. This might possibly the most-adopted Java style guide in the world, and several other guides have been derived from it (examples: [Android](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/style-guide), [Javascript](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)).
* [Understanding classes and types in Java](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G5dNQ0kQwA5zefGdP_nvFJByb63QNlz0XiSjltiJM84/preview?resourcekey=0-HXOJZriWDQ_lN0iqZR9nXQ)
* [Data in Java programs: a basic conceptual model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J-a_K87P-R3TscD4uW2Qsbt5BlBR_7uX_BekwJ5BLSE/preview)
* How to think about time -- I'm looking forward to sharing this one soon.

### Current projects 

* Head of the [JSpecify](http://jspecify.org) working group
* Representative to [Project Amber](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/amber/) working group
* Representative to [Project Valhalla](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/valhalla/) working group
* I work in groups
