### Work

After a string of failed startups, I started at Google since 2004, and founded the
Java Core Libraries Team in 2007. And that basically catches us up! Yes, I've been
on the same team for 15 years. I am truly blessed.

If you're curious, you could learn a bit about what I do from the
[start of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPW2Pz2dI9E) until you get bored.
(The main topic of the video isn't that important.)

#### Things I've done

I have played *some* part in creating these things. I'm generally still connected to these projects, just not very active.

* [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) - This was my idea, and I drove it at first, but had immeasurable help from hundreds of others
* [Error Prone](https://errorprone.info/) - I wrote none of this except some docs, but have been highly 
* [AutoValue](https://github.com/google/auto/blob/master/value/userguide/index.md) - With Ã‰amonn McManus; he wrote all the code.
* [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) - By John DeTreville and Liam Miller-Cushon; I product-managed and tech-wroted.
* [Truth](https://github.com/google/truth) - Christian Gruber, Kurt Kluever, Chris Povirk, and others. I contributed long excruciating design reviews.
* [Flogger](https://github.com/google/flogger) - all credit to David Beaumont. I helped a little.
* [Caliper](https://github.com/google/caliper) - Jesse Wilson and I made this together, with help from Jeremy Sharpe and a major rewrite from Greg Kick. It is unloved now.
* [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice) - Guice 1.0 was crazybob's baby but I was the midwife. Sadly I didn't do much of anything for it since.
* [Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger) - Helped a little, but it was all Jesse Wilson and Greg Kick.
* [JSR 335](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=335) - Brian Goetz and many others; I joined in progress and helped various design decisions, including paring some of the API surfaces down
