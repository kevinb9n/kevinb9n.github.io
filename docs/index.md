### Work

After a string of failed startups, I started at Google since 2004, and founded the
Java Core Libraries Team in 2007. And that basically catches us up! Yes, I've been
on the same team for 15 years. I am truly blessed.

If you're curious, you could learn a bit about what I do from the
[start of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPW2Pz2dI9E) until you get bored.
(The main topic of the video isn't that important.)
