## Work

After working at 6 small companies over about 8 years, I joined Google in 2004. In 2007 I founded the Java Core Libraries team, and I'm still there today! (We are now named Java And Kotlin Ecosystems.)

If you're very curious, you could learn a bit about what I do from the [start of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPW2Pz2dI9E) until you get bored.

### Things I did

I've played some important part in creating these things. I'm generally still connected to these projects but (frustratingly to many, I'm sure), not able to pay much active attention to them nowadays.

* I made [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) with much early help from Jared Levy, Mike Bostock, Joshua Bloch, Jesse Wilson, Chris Povirk, Louis Wasserman, and others.
* I helped crazybob create Guice 1.0. A fair amount of the API design is me. The fact that it worked was all Bob.
* [AutoValue](https://github.com/google/auto/blob/master/value/userguide/index.md) was my idea/design and I sort of product-managed and tech-wrote. Ã‰amonn McManus made it happen and has maintained it well.
* I worked as hard on [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) as it's possible to work on a thing without writing any of the code. It is really the creation of John DeTreville and Liam Miller-Cushon. 
* Jesse Wilson, Gregory Kick, and I created [Caliper](https://github.com/google/caliper). It's dying now; [JMH](https://github.com/openjdk/jmh) is basically just better now.
* I've been closely involved in [Error Prone](https://errorprone.info/) (including Refaster) since its early days, helping Alex Eagle, Liam Miller-Cushon, Eddie Aftandillian, and Louis Wasserman (again, like most Google projects, *many* people have contributed).
* Deep API discussions and reviews for [Truth](https://github.com/google/truth) (Christian Gruber, Chris Povirk, Kurt Kluever), David Beaumont's [Flogger](https://github.com/google/flogger), and Colin Decker's [jimfs](https://github.com/google/jimfs). For whatever it matters, I still believe these are all excellent libraries, which we failed to evangelize.
* I've been Google's representative to [JSR 330](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=330), [JSR 335](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=335), Project Valhalla, Project Amber, and maybe another I'm forgetting. Particularly with Valhalla I've had a strong influence on the design... so I hope y'all like it when it gets here.

### Things I wrote

* [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), with Erik Hilsdale. This might possibly the most-adopted Java style guide in the world, and several other guides have been derived from it (examples: [Android](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/style-guide), [Javascript](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)).
* [Understanding classes and types in Java](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G5dNQ0kQwA5zefGdP_nvFJByb63QNlz0XiSjltiJM84/preview?resourcekey=0-HXOJZriWDQ_lN0iqZR9nXQ)
* [Data in Java programs: a basic conceptual model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J-a_K87P-R3TscD4uW2Qsbt5BlBR_7uX_BekwJ5BLSE/preview)
* How to think about time -- I'm looking forward to sharing this one soon.

### Current projects 

* Head of [JSpecify](http://jspecify.org) working group
* Representative to [Project Amber](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/amber/) working group
* Representative to [Project Valhalla](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/valhalla/) working group
* I work in groups
