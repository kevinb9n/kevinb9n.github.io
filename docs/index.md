# Kevin Bourrillion

Hello! Nice to meet you.

## The other me's

I'm `kevinb9n` most places.

## Work

After a few startups I worked at Google for nearly two decades (2004 to 2024). In 2007 I founded the Java Core Libraries (now Java And Kotlin Ecosystem) team and stayed with it rest of my time there. Then I was hit with the [layoff hammer](https://twitter.com/kevinb9n/status/1745890746350321818) and now I'm enjoying some me-time.

If you're very curious, you could learn a bit about the kind of stuff I do from the [start of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPW2Pz2dI9E) until you get bored. My mission is basically to make the world's Java code more readable, bug-proof, and adaptable, any way I can.

### Things I did

I've played *some* important part in creating the following things. Clearly I love to collaborate. Often it might sound like I didn't do that much, but listen man.

I'm not able to pay much active attention to them nowadays.

* I founded [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) with much early help from Jared Levy, Mike Bostock, Joshua Bloch, Jesse Wilson, Bob Lee, Chris Povirk, Louis Wasserman, Chris Nokleberg, and others. I spearheaded, but it would be ludicrous to think I could have done it alone.
* I helped Bob Lee (crazybob) create Guice 1.0. A fair amount of the API design is me. The fact that it worked was all Bob. Working with him was a fantastic and formative experience for me, and I mourn his loss tremendously.
* [AutoValue](https://github.com/google/auto/blob/master/value/userguide/index.md) was my idea/design and I sort of product-managed and tech-wrote. Ã‰amonn McManus made it happen and has maintained it well.
* I worked as hard on [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) as it's possible to work on a thing without writing any of the code. It is really the creation of John DeTreville and Liam Miller-Cushon. I made tough decisions and ate the flak.
* Jesse Wilson, Gregory Kick, and I created [Caliper](https://github.com/google/caliper). It's dying now; [JMH](https://github.com/openjdk/jmh) is... just better.
* I've been involved in [Error Prone](https://errorprone.info/) (including Refaster) since its early days, helping Alex Eagle, Liam Miller-Cushon, Eddie Aftandillian, and Louis Wasserman (again, like most Google projects, *many* people have contributed).
* Deep API discussions and reviews for [Truth](https://github.com/google/truth) (Christian Gruber, Chris Povirk, Kurt Kluever), David Beaumont's [Flogger](https://github.com/google/flogger), and Colin Decker's [jimfs](https://github.com/google/jimfs). For whatever it matters, I still believe these are all excellent libraries, which might be better known if we had really evangelized them.
* I was Google's representative to [JSR 330](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=330), [JSR 335](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=335), Project Valhalla, Project Amber. For the ones still active I'm now an individual member. Particularly with Valhalla I've had some influence on the design, so I hope y'all like it when it gets here.

### Things I wrote

* [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), with Erik Hilsdale. This is probably (?) the most-adopted Java style guide in the world, and several other guides have been derived from it (examples: [Android](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/style-guide), [Javascript](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)).
* [Understanding classes and types in Java](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G5dNQ0kQwA5zefGdP_nvFJByb63QNlz0XiSjltiJM84/preview?resourcekey=0-HXOJZriWDQ_lN0iqZR9nXQ)
* [Data in Java programs: a basic conceptual model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J-a_K87P-R3TscD4uW2Qsbt5BlBR_7uX_BekwJ5BLSE/preview)
* More should be coming soon in 2024...

### Current projects 

* [JSpecify](http://jspecify.org) working group
* Representative to [Project Valhalla](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/valhalla/) working group
* Representative to [Project Amber](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/amber/) working group

## Play

I like board games. My favorite is Terraforming Mars. I have some stuff [here](http://github.com/MartianZoo) fans might be interested in, including a game engine library.

I like math a lot and used to coach a Math Olympiad team for 10-year-olds before covid. I was really good at it aside from the ways in which I was bad at it.

In a good year I'm into cycling and might ride about 4K road miles. In a bad year I'm into sitting on the couch.

### Music

I play guitar passably, sing pretty good, play drums less than passably, play keyboards badly, and (like every guitar player) I fancy that I can play the bass too but can't really. I love music. I put some stuff up on YouTube, some I feel good about, some I really don't. I guess I feel good about [Ring of Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T86TskoXB8s).

I like indie-ish pop-ish rock-ish melodic music like Belle & Sebastian and Vampire Weekend. One musical artist very special to me is **Melissa Kaplan aka Universal Hall Pass**, formerly of Splashdown. If you've played the Assassin's Creed games you've actually heard her voice a lot. Her singing, lyrics, vocal arrangements, and overall musicality are out of this world. No one really knows about her, which breaks my heart. [Try out this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGbvfaO4ht4&list=PLLkghk8DC6eb-eMh8syfH1UfGDs55B8Da), and if for some reason you don't like one song just try another.
